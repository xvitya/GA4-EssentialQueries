| app      | ad_impression       | ad_event_id, value*                                          | When a user sees an ad impression.                                    |
| app      | ad_query            | ad_event_id                                                 | When an ad request is made by the Mobile Ads SDK.                    |

| app      | adunit_exposure     | firebase_screen, firebase_screen_id, firebase_screen_class, exposure_time | When an ad unit served by the Mobile Ads SDK is on screen.           |
| app      | app_clear_data      |                                                             | When the user resets/clears the app data, removing all settings and sign-in data (Android only).|
| app      | app_exception       | fatal, timestamp, engagement_time_msec                       | When the app crashes or throws an exception.                          |
| app      | app_remove          |                                                             | When an application package is removed (uninstalled) from an Android device (Android only). This event is different from the Daily uninstalls by device and Daily uninstalls by user metrics, which are both reported by Google Play Developer Console. The app_remove event counts the removal of application packages, regardless of the installation source, and the count changes depending on the date range you are using for the report. The Daily uninstalls by device and Daily uninstalls by user metrics count the removal of application packages only when they were installed from Google Play, and are reported on a daily basis.|

The previous app version id is passed as a parameter. This event is conceptually different from the Daily upgrades by device metric, which is reported by Google Play Developer Console. An upgrade refers to the updating of the application binary, whereas an app_update event is triggered upon the subsequent launch of the upgraded app.|
| app      | click               | link_classes, link_domain, link_id, link_url, outbound (boolean) | Each time a user clicks a link that leads away from the current domain.

| app      | dynamic_link_first_open | source, medium, campaign, link_id, accept_time           | When a user opens the app for the first time via a dynamic link (Note: This event is being phased out as Firebase Dynamic Links is currently deprecated. Learn more about these changes.)|
| app      | error               | firebase_error, firebase_error_value                        | Logged in place of an event that can't be logged because it is invalid in some way. This event does not appear in reports and is not exported to BigQuery.|
| app      | file_download       | file_extension, file_name link_classes, link_id, link_text, link_url | When a user clicks a link leading to a file (with a common file extension) of the following types: document, text, executable, presentation, compressed file, video, audio.

| app      | first_open          | previous_gmp_app_id, updated_with_analytics, previous_first_open_count, system_app, system_app_update, deferred_analytics_collection, reset_analytics_cause, engagement_time_msec | The first time a user launches an app after installing or re-installing it. This event is not triggered when a user downloads the app onto a device, but instead when he or she first uses it. To see raw download numbers, look in Google Play Developer Console or in iTunesConnect. Supports measuring first_open conversions for users who accept Apple's iOS 14 app-tracking prompt.|
| web      | first_visit         |                                                             | The first time a user visits a website or launches an Android instant app with Analytics enabled.|

| app      | in_app_purchase     | product_id, price, value, currency, quantity, subscription, free_trial, introductory_price | When a user completes an in-app purchase, including an initial subscription, that is processed by the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. The product ID, product name, currency, and quantity are passed as parameters. This event is triggered only by versions of your app that include the Google Analytics for Firebase SDK. Android: To see in-app purchase data for Android apps, link Analytics to Google Play. Note that Analytics doesn't automatically measure paid-app purchase revenue. Also, your reported revenue in Google Analytics may differ from the values you see in the Google Play Developer Console. Analytics ignores events that are flagged as invalid or tests. Learn more about testing Google Play billing. iOS: Note that Analytics doesn't automatically measure paid-app purchase revenue and refunds. Analytics ignores events that are flagged as invalid or sandbox.|
